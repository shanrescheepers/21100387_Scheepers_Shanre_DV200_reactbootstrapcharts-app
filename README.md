### All The Latest UFC 2022 Fight Events

Using the sportsdata io MMA API, I collected and collated all 2022 UFC events data into a simple unchallenging Angular back and foreground!

<!-- CONCEPT PROCESS -->
<!-- Briefly explain your concept ideation process -->
<!-- here you will add things like wireframing, data structure planning, anything that shows your process. You need to include images-->
## Concept Process
`Conceptual Process`
The Web App concept came from my fanlove for the UFC as well as my passion of being an MMA AM-fighter in training.
Sportdata io was the only database that supplies the one and only MMA API and I decided to choose and integrate this API.
Starting the project with a basic html and css file was mundane for me and I veered over to changing the project into a angularfire app.
The idea of a virtual dom and assets and data appearing and dissapearing as whar REact does, was appealing, thus my research into angular started.
Numerous hours spent debugging proved the challenge was worth it.
The design of the UI, made with angular ui, is minimalistic, simple, and to the point.

### Wireframes

<!-- DEVELOPMENT PROCESS -->
## Development Process

The `Development Process` is the technical implementations and functionality done in the frontend and backend of the application.

### Implementation Process
<!-- stipulate all of the functionality you included in the project -->
<!-- This is your time to shine, explain the technical nuances of your project, how did you achieve the final outcome!-->

* Utilized and implemented `React` for a dynamic web app.

* Implementation of NPM. 
* Integration of chart js and bootstrap .
* Implemented KISS method and achieved easier css skills.
* Async await  used iso axios.get. 
* API End Point for Fighters: https://api.sportsdata.io/v3/mma/scores/json/Fighters?(key)
* Dashboard UI design
* Dynamic API calls injection into charts
* Use of react hooks
* Achieved a minimalistic designed web app, yet a powerful reminder to fans of the UFC.


#### Highlights
<!-- stipulated the highlight you experienced with the project -->
*Completion of project
*Understanding of work
*Debugging
*Asking and answering questions on Stack
*Writing markdown

#### Challenges
<!-- stipulated the challenges you faced with the project and why you think you faced it or how you think you'll solve it (if not solved) -->
* Learnign React as I feel more comfortable with Angular
* Debugging
* Creating a visually pleasing Dashboard
* Sending props through
* Creating a timeline chart with an API that doesn't always allow for hsitorical data, thus the historical data of moneylines/odds was succesfully implemented

#### Above And Beyond

What aspects of this final build contribute to the `Above And Beyond` Component of your brief?
<!-- what did you learn outside of the classroom and implement into your project-->
* Prop injection into the HTMl and using states to have fighter searches populate more dynamicall and user-journey friendly


### Future Implementation
<!-- stipulate functionality and improvements that can be implemented in the future. -->

* Material UI
* Images
* Themed UI
* Lottie, which failed at the last minute
<!-- MOCKUPS -->
